Let visitors search your BuddyPress Members Directory and their Friends list.

== Description ==

With BP Profile Search you can build custom Members search forms, and custom Members directories or search results pages. Visitors can search your BuddyPress Members directory and, if they are Members, their Friends list.

You can insert the search forms in a Members directory, in a sidebar or widget area, or in any post or page without modifying your theme.

When visitors click the *Search* button, they are redirected to your form's Members directory that shows their search results. The *All Members* tab shows all the results, while the *My Friends* tab shows the results found among your visitor's friends.

Requires at least BuddyPress 1.8 -- Tested up to BuddyPress 2.5

== Installation ==

After the standard plugin installation procedure, you'll be able to access the plugin settings page *Users -> Profile Search*, where you can build and customize your search forms.

= Form Fields =

In this section you can:

* Add and remove form fields
* Enter the field label and description, or leave them empty to use the default
* Enable the *Value Range Search* for numeric fields, or the *Age Range Search* for date fields
* Change the order of the fields

= Form Attributes =

In this section you can select your form's *method* attribute:

* POST: the form data are not visible in the URL and it's not possible to bookmark the results page
* GET: the form data are sent as URL variables and it's possible to bookmark the results page

You can also select your form's *action* attribute. The *action* attribute points to your form's results page, that could be:

* The BuddyPress Members Directory page
* A custom Members Directory page

You can create a custom Members Directory page using the shortcode **[bps_directory]**, and you can even use a custom directory template. To learn more, read the [Custom Directories](http://dontdream.it/bp-profile-search/custom-directories/) tutorial.

= Add to Directory =

With this option you can insert your search form in its Members Directory page. If you enable *Add to Directory*, you can also:

* Select the form template to use
* Enter the HTML text for the optional form header
* Enable the *Toggle Form* option
* Enter the text for the *Toggle Form* button

= Text Search Mode =

With this option you can select your text search mode. The modes are:

* *contains*: a search for *John* finds *John*, *Johnson*, *Long John Silver*, and so on
* *is*: a search for *John* finds *John* only
* *is like*: same as above, but with optional wildcard characters

In the last mode, the allowed wildcard characters are:

* Percent sign (%): matches any text, or no text at all
* Underscore (_): matches any single character

= Display your search form =

After you build your search form, you can display it:

* In its Members Directory page, selecting the option *Add to Directory*
* In a sidebar or widget area, using the widget *Profile Search*
* In a post or page, using the shortcode **[bps_display form=id template=tpl]** (*)
* Anywhere in your theme, using the PHP code<br>
**&lt;?php do_action ('bps_display_form', id, tpl); ?&gt;** (*)

(*) Replace 'id' with your actual form ID, and 'tpl' with the name of the form template you want to use.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 4.3 =
Note: If you, or your theme, are using a modified 4.2.x or 4.3 template, you have to edit and update it to the current template structure before upgrading. If you haven't modified the built-in templates instead, you can upgrade safely.

= 4.1 =
Note: If you are upgrading from version 4.0.x, you have to update your existing forms with your Directory page selection. Go to *Users -> Profile Search*, *Edit* each form, select its *Form Action (Results Directory)* and *Update*.

= 4.0 =
Note: BP Profile Search version 4 is not compatible with version 3. When you first upgrade to version 4, you have to reconfigure your BP Profile Search forms and widgets, and modify any BP Profile Search shortcodes and *do_action* codes you are using.
In a multisite installation, the BP Profile Search settings page is in the individual Site Admin(s), and no longer in the Network Admin.
